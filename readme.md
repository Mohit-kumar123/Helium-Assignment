# 📖 Overview

ShopperSense AI is an AI-powered ecommerce personalization application that analyzes a shopper's browsing journey using Google Gemini.

Instead of relying on hardcoded business rules, the application leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand shopper behavior from an event sequence and generates:

- Shopper Classification
- Confidence Score
- Supporting Evidence
- Personalized Recommendations

The application demonstrates how LLMs can be integrated into real-world ecommerce workflows while following a clean, production-ready architecture.
